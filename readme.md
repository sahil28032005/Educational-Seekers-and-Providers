## üöÄ About the Project

This **Real-Time Connection and Notification Platform** leverages **Apache Kafka**, **Zookeeper**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Socket Programming** to provide seamless real-time notifications and bidirectional communication. This platform is designed to scale, ensuring high availability and low latency communication for modern web applications.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Push notifications to users as events occur.
- **High Throughput Messaging:** Powered by Apache Kafka for distributed event streaming.
- **Reliable Data Coordination:** Zookeeper ensures robust service orchestration.
- **Persistent Storage:** PostgreSQL is used for storing user and event data securely.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Socket programming enables instant updates and real-time interactivity.

---

## üìã Requirements

- **Java 8 or later** (for Kafka and Zookeeper)
- **Node.js** (for backend server with sockets)
- **PostgreSQL 13+**
- **Docker** (optional for containerized deployment)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-platform.git
cd real-time-platform
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db
KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
ZOOKEEPER_HOST=localhost:2181
SOCKET_PORT=3000
```

### 3. Start Services
#### Using Docker Compose (recommended):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Manual Setup:
- Start **Zookeeper**:
  ```bash
  bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
  ```
- Start **Kafka**:
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  ```
- Start **PostgreSQL** and create the database manually.
- Run the backend server:
  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```

## üñáÔ∏è Usage

1. Start the platform services (Zookeeper, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and the backend server).
2. Establish socket connections using the client-side SDK or API.
3. Publish messages to Kafka topics to trigger real-time notifications.
4. Monitor system logs for event streams and client connections.

---

## üìä System Architecture

The platform follows this architecture:

1. **Kafka Topics:** Handle event streams for notifications.
2. **Zookeeper:** Manages Kafka brokers and distributed systems coordination.
3. **PostgreSQL:** Stores user data and message history.
4. **Socket Server:** Handles client connections and real-time communication.
